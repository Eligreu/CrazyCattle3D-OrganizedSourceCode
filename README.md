CrazyCattle3D Source Code buts its more easy to mod it! (i guess)
Organized source code made by Eligreu.
Original game from Anna

# Confused on how to mod it?
Check the tutorial i made on my yt channel (Eligreu) 
First tutorial is out! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdA2PjJnO5c&t=7s

I used GDRETOOLS to decompile Original CrazyCattle3D
i just made it more easy to create new levels and stuff like that
if you know a bit of godot engine and gdscript, it will be more easier to make new levels!

# THE ORIGINAL GAME WAS MADE BY ANNA, IN ITCH IO
