# CrazyCattle3D-SourceCode

An Organized CrazyCattle3D Source Code
      made by Eligreu
  Original CrazyCattle3D 
      made by Anna
    (or 4nn4 in itch io)

I used GDRETOOLS to decompile Original CrazyCattle3D
i just made it more easy to create new levels and stuff like that
if you know a bit of godot engine and gdscript, it will be more easier to make new levels!

I made an tutorial of how to make an Modded CrazyCattle3D in my youtube channel (Eligreu)!
check it out!
